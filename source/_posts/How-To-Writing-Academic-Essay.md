# 写在前面

最近正在写学术论文，无意间拜读到了一篇国外大牛的文章，里面详细的讲解了如何去组织、撰写一篇学术论文。我把这个文章原文放在这里，也加入了一些自己的理解，希望对看到这篇博客的人能有所帮助吧。。。

# Writing Introductions

There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or assignment. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:

* establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic
* indicate a problem, controversy or a gap in the field of study
* define the topic or key terms
* state of the purpose of the essay/writing
* provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing 

> Introduction的结构：背景，问题，目的，结构

Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions are listed below. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the categories under which the phrases are listed.

Introductory sections for research dissertations, are normally much more complex than this and, as well as the elements above, may include the following: `a synopsis of key literature/current state of knowledge `, `synopsis of methods` ,`lists of research questions or hypotheses to be tested`, `significance of the study`, `recognition of the limitations of the study, reasons for personal interest in the topic`.

## Being Critical

As an academic writer, you are expected to be critical of the sources that you use. This essentially means questioning what you read and not necessarily agreeing with it just because the information has been published. Being critical can also mean looking for reasons why we should not just accept something as being correct or true. This can require you to identify problems with a writer's arguments or methods, or perhaps to refer to other people's criticisms of these. Constructive criticism goes beyond this by suggesting ways in which a piece of research or writing could be improved.
*.....being against is not enough. We also need to develop habits of constructive thinking. Edward de Bono*

# Reporting Results

The standrard approach is to this section of dissertations is to `merely` present the results, without elaborate discussion or comment. This does not mean that you do not need any text to describe data presented in tables and figures. Writers usually comment on the significant data presented in the tables and figures. This often takes the form of the location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content. This may be followed by a statement or statements which point out and describe the relevant or significant data. All your tables should be numbered and given a title.

More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the **Discussion section**. In research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under the heading: Results and Discussion.
