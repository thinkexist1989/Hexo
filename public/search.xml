    <content type="text"><![CDATA[写在前面最近正在写学术论文，无意间拜读到了一篇国外大牛的文章，里面详细的讲解了如何去组织、撰写一篇学术论文。我把这个文章原文放在这里，也加入了一些自己的理解，希望对看到这篇博客的人能有所帮助吧。。。 Writing IntroductionsThere are many ways to introduce an academic essay or assignment. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions: establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic indicate a problem, controversy or a gap in the field of study define the topic or key terms state of the purpose of the essay/writing provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing Introduction的结构：背景，问题，目的，结构 Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions are listed below. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the categories under which the phrases are listed. Introductory sections for research dissertations, are normally much more complex than this and, as well as the elements above, may include the following: a synopsis of key literature/current state of knowledge, synopsis of methods ,lists of research questions or hypotheses to be tested, significance of the study, recognition of the limitations of the study, reasons for personal interest in the topic. Establishing the importance of the topicOne of the most significant current discussions in legal and moral philososphy is ……It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the …..X is the leading cause of death in western industrialised countries.X is a common disorder characterised by ……X is an important component in the climate system, and plays a key role in Y.In the new global economy, X has become a central issue for ……In the history of development economics, X has been thought of as a key factor in …….Xs are one of the most widely used groups of antibacterial agents and ……Xs are the most potent anti-infammatory agents known. Recent developments in X have heightened the need for ……In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in ……Recent developments in the field of X have led to a renewed interest in ……Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in ……The past decade has seen the rapid development of X in many …….The past thirty years have seen increasingly rapid advances in the field of……Over the past century there has been a dramatic increase in ……One of the most important events of the 1970s was ……Traditionally, Xs have subscribed to the belief that ……X proved an important literary genre in the early Y community.The changes experienced by Xs over the past decade remain unprecedented.Xs are one of the most widely used groups of antibacterial agents and have been extensively used for decades to ……. Highlighting a problem or controversy in the field of study 研究领域有争议，有问题的写法 However, these rapid changes are having a serious effect ……However, a major problem with this kind of application is ……To date there has been little agreement on what ……More recently, literature has emerged that offers contradictory findings about …..There is increasing concern that some Xs are being disadvantaged ……Despite its long clinical success, X has a number of problems in use.Despite its safety and efficacy, X suffers from several major drawbacks:Concerns have been raised by several relevant bodies about the poor ……One of the most significant current discussions in legal and moral philososphy is ……One observer has already drawn attention to the paradox in ……In many Xs a debate is taking place between Ys and Zs concerning ……The controversy about scientific evidence for X has raged unabated for over a century.The issue of X has been a controversial and much disputed subject within the field of …….The issue has grown in importancein light of recent ……One major theoretical issue that has dominated the field for many years concerns ……One major issue in early X research concerned……. 研究领域有问题被忽视 So far, however, there has been little discussion about ……However, far too little attention has been paid to ……Most studies in X have only been carried out in a small number of areas.The research to date has tended to focus on X rather than Y.In addition, no research has been found that surveyed …….So far this method has only been applied to ……Several studies have produced estimates of X (Smith, 2002; Jones, 2003), but there is still insufficient data for …..However, there have been no controlled studies which compare differences in……The experimental data arerather controversial, and there is no general agreement about …… Focus and aimThis paper will focus on/examine/give an account of ……This paper seeks to address the following questions: …..This essay critically examines/discusses/traces ……The purpose of this paper is to review recent research into the ……This paper will review the research conducted on ……In this paper I argue that …..This chapter reviews the literature concerning the usefulness of using ……The aim of this paper is to determine/examine ……The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate …… Outline of structureThe main questions/issues addressed in this paper are: a), b and c).This paper has been divided into four parts. The first part deals with ……The essay has been organised in the following way.This paper first gives a brief overview of the recent history of X.This paper begins by …… It will then go on to ……The first section of this paper will examine ……Finally, …….Chapter 2 begins by laying out the theoretical dimensions of the research, and looks at how ……Chapter 3 describes the design, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of ……The last chapter assesses the …… Explaining KeywordsWhile a variety of definitions of the term X have been suggested, this paper will use the definition first suggested by Smith (1968) who saw it as …….Throughout this paper the term X will refer to/will be used to refer to …….In this article the acronym/abbreviation XYZ will be used. Being CriticalAs an academic writer, you are expected to be critical of the sources that you use. This essentially means questioning what you read and not necessarily agreeing with it just because the information has been published. Being critical can also mean looking for reasons why we should not just accept something as being correct or true. This can require you to identify problems with a writer’s arguments or methods, or perhaps to refer to other people’s criticisms of these. Constructive criticism goes beyond this by suggesting ways in which a piece of research or writing could be improved.…..being against is not enough. We also need to develop habits of constructive thinking. Edward de Bono Introducing questions, problems and limitationstheoryOne question that needs to be asked, however, is whether ……A serious weakness with this argument, however, is that ……One of the limitations with this explanation is that it does not explain why …..One criticism of much of the literature on X is that ……The key problem with this explanation is that ……The existing accounts fail to resolve the contradiction between X and Y.However, there is an inconsistency with this argument.Smith’s argument relies too heavily on qualitative analysis of ……It seems that Jones’ understanding of the X framework is questionable.Smith’s interpretation overlooks much of the historical research ……One major criticism of Smith’s work is that …..Many writers have challenged Jones&#39; claim on the grounds that ……. method/practiceAnother problem with this approach is that it fails totake X into account.Perhaps the most serious disadvantage of this method is that …..Difficulties arise, however, when an attempt is made to implement the policy.Nevertheless, the strategy has not escaped criticism from governments, agencies and academics.One major drawback of this approach is that ……The main limitation of biosynthetic incorporation, however, is ……However, this method of analysis has a number of limitations.However, approaches of this kind carry with them various well known limitations.All the studies reviewed so far, however, suffer from the fact that …However, all the previously mentioned methods suffer from some serious limitations/weaknesses/disadvantages/drawbacks. Identifying a study’s weaknessthe main weakness of the study is the failure to address how …….the study fails to consider the differing categories of damage that …..the research does not take into account pre-existing …… such as ……the author offers no explanation for the distinction between X and Y.Smith makes no attempt to differentiate between various different types of X.Jones fails to fully acknowledge the significance of ……the paper would appear to be over ambitious in its claimsthe author overlooks the fact that X contributes to Y.what Smith fails to do is to draw a distinction between ……another weakness is that we are given no explanantion of how …… Offering constructive suggestionsSmith&#39;s paper/Her conclusions/The study/The findings would/might have been more/much more/far more useful/convincing/interesting/persuasive/original if he/she/author had included/considered/adopted/used….. A better study would examine a large, randomly selected sample of societies with ……A much more systematic study would identify how X interacts with other variables that are believed to be linked to …… Introducing other people’s criticismsHowever, Jones (2003) points out that …..Many analysts now argue that the strategy of X has not been successful. Jones (2003), for example, argues that …..Non-government agencies are also very critical of the new policies.The X theory has been vigorously / strongly challenged in recent years by a number of writers.Smith’s analysis has been criticised by a number of writers. Jones (1993), for example, points out that ……Smith’s meta-analysis has been subjected to considerable criticism.The most important of these criticisms is that Smith failed to note that ……Jones (2003) is probably the best known critic of the X theory. He argues that .….The latter point has been devastatingly critiqued by Jones (2003).Critics have also argued that not only do social surveys provide an inaccurate measure of X, but the……Critics question the ability of poststructuralist theory to provide ……More recent arguments against X have been summarised by Smith and Jones (1982):Jones (2003) is critical of the conclusions that Smith draws from his findings. Reporting ResultsThe standrard approach is to this section of dissertations is to merely present the results, without elaborate discussion or comment. This does not mean that you do not need any text to describe data presented in tables and figures. Writers usually comment on the significant data presented in the tables and figures. This often takes the form of the location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content. This may be followed by a statement or statements which point out and describe the relevant or significant data. All your tables should be numbered and given a title. More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under the heading: Results and Discussion. Reference to aim/methodTo assess X, the Y questionnaire was used.To distinguish between these two possibilities, ……In order to assess Z, repeated measures of ANOVA were used.Regression analysis was used to predict the ……Changes in X and Y were compared using ……The average scores of X and Y were compared in order to ……Nine items on the questionnaire measured the extent to which ……The correlation between X and Y was tested.The first set of analyses examined the impact of ……Simple statistical analysis was used to ……A scatter diagram and a Pearson’s product moment correlation were used to determine the relationship between ……T-tests were used to analyse the relationship between …… 学术论文中一般对方法的描述都是被动语态，例如 be used to…..

    <url>%2F2017%2F10%2F17%2FHexo%2BGithub%20Pages%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[写在前面折腾了整整一周，终于搭建好了我的个人博客。感谢互联网的发达让信息共享如此方便，让我仅仅用了不到三天就弄好了自己的独立博客。在这篇博客的最后我也会列出非常值得参考的几篇博客教程与网站供大家学习。 准备工作在打造个人博客之前，需要进行以下准备工作： Github账号注册 这是为了在Github上部署你的博客，相当于申请了一个服务器，空间免费。 七牛账号注册 由于Github上的免费空间有限，一些大图片保存在Github上会占用空间，七牛上提供免费的10G空间，可以存储一些图片视频之类文件。 申请一个域名 有了独立域名，逼格才能满满~我是在腾讯云申请的域名，一年10多块钱。 有了这些，就可以开始打造自己的独立博客了，那么首先我们在电脑上安装一些软件。 软件安装我是在Windows下使用Github的，所以需要安装以下软件： Node.js 一个基于 Chrome V8 引擎的JavaScript 运行时 Git 用来部署Git 有了这两个软件，其实就已经可以开始接下来的部署Hexo了。不过由于Hexo是用Markdown语言来写博客的，为了方便起见，我推荐一个Markdown的编辑器： Typora 超级好用，界面还美观 Visual Studio Code 微软推出的代码编辑器，因为配置Hexo时候需要修改一些xml文件，感觉这个编辑器挺好用的 好啦，软件安装完毕，那么我们就开始配置域名吧~ 域名配置域名申请完之后要设置域名解析，设置如下： 域名的DNS要设置为：f1g1ns1.dnspod.net 和 f1g1ns2.dnspod.net 主机记录 记录类型 记录值 @ A 192.30.252.153 @ A 192.30.252.154 www CNAME githubname.github.io 其中githubname为自己的github账号名称，这样你自己申请域名就能够解析到你的Github Pages上了。 配置Github我们要配置SSH keys将本地的Git项目与远程Github建立联系 检查电脑上现有的SSH keys:1$ cd ~/. ssh 检查本机SSH keys 如果提示：No such file or directory 说明为第一次使用Git 生成新的SSH key：1$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;邮件地址@youremail.com&quot; 之后回车，然后输密码，以后提交项目的时候就输入这个密码。 将本机的SSH key添加到Github上，在id_rsa.pub文件中。登陆Github-&gt;Accout Settings-&gt;SSH Public keys-&gt;add another public keys，把文件中的密钥粘贴到里面，点击add key。 测试一下，输入以下命令 1$ ssh -T git@github.com 设置用户信息： 12$ git config --global user.name &quot;cnfeat&quot;//用户名$ git config --global user.email &quot;cnfeat@gmail.com&quot;//填写自己的邮箱 在Github上创建一个新仓库，名字后缀固定，比如我的Github账号为thinkexist1989，那么仓库的名字就要设置为thinkexist1989.github.io. 搭建Hexo框架Hexo是一个简单、快速、强大的博客发布工具，支持Markdown格式。 安装Hexo打开Git Bash 1$ npm install -g hexo 部署Hexo新建一个文件夹，然后在这个文件夹中运行Git Bash 1$ hexo init Hexo随后会在这个文件夹下生成网站所需要的所有文件，之后可以本地部署并查看生成的网页12$ hexo g$ hexo s -p 5000 然后在浏览器输入localhost:5000便可以查看网页了(因为我安了福昕PDF，占用了4000端口)，建议使用Chrome浏览器 安装NeXT主题参考中的[NeXT主题官方网站][NeXT主题官方网站]中有更加详细的安装与配置说明，在这里只简单介绍一下安装步骤： 下载主题在Hexo文件夹下运行Git Bash：1$ git clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next themes/next 启用主题打开Hexo根目录下的_config.xml文件，找到theme字段，将其值改成next 1theme:next 这样便配置好了NeXT主题，NeXT具有丰富的功能与样式配置，具体的可以参考[NeXT主题官方网站][NeXT主题官方网站] 发布博客博客需要用Markdown语言编写，写好之后，将博客放到source-&gt;_post文件夹下，这里就是存放所有博客文件的地方，之后执行如下命令：12$ hexo clean$ hexo g -d 执行完上述语句之后，GIthub上便已经部署好了，但是还有一个重要的步骤：登陆Github，进入博客的仓库，新建一个文件，重命名为CNAME，内容填写为你自己的域名，比如www.yluoblog.cn。之后保存。这样在网页中输入自己的域名，才能够解析到Github Pages。 写在后面从无到有，经过自己的一顿折腾，在网页中输入自己的域名可以登录到博客的那一刻，心情真的是很激动！我之后也会将我所学到一些东西在博客中分享出来！学习是一个快乐的过程，希望每个人都能从学习中找到属于自己的快乐！ 参考 如何搭建一个独立博客——简明Github Pages与Hexo教程 如何使用10个小时搭建出个人域名而又Geek的独立博客？ Hexo官方网站 NeXT主题官方网站]]></content>
